# Supervised Machine Learning Exercise Practice

This project is a hands-on exploration of fundamental concepts in supervised machine learning. It focuses on key algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Multiple Variables Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Trees**, and other essential techniques. The purpose of the project is to provide practical experience while reinforcing theoretical knowledge from the **Machine Learning Specialization** course.

## Project Overview

Throughout this project, you will implement various supervised learning algorithms. Each section corresponds to specific topics discussed in the course lectures, reinforcing learning through practical coding exercises and implementations.

### Key Algorithms Covered:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Variables Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Other Essential Supervised Learning Techniques**

The project will guide you step-by-step in implementing these algorithms, enabling you to better understand their functionality, application, and practical use cases.
